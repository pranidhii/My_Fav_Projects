Problem : Build a good prediction of the taxi app duration between multiple points.

Data Dictionary:{ pickup datetime: a variable containing a date and a time specifying the date and thetime the taxi picked of a passenger. For instance, you may observe a pickup datetimeof \6/14/2034 3:00:00 AM", which indicates the time the taxi picked up the passenger.12Note that you may also obtain the day of the week, or the season information fromthis dataset. For instance, if we look up the 2034 calendar (search it on Google), youwould see that \6/14/2034" is a Wednesday.{ NumberOfPassengers: The number of passengers loaded to the cab. Note that allpassengers are loaded together and are dropped o together. So in case you see 5 peopleloaded, it means they all got to the cab together and all got o at the destination.{ pickup x: This is a variable that represents the x coordinate of the location the taxipicked up the passenger.{ pickup y: This is a variable that represents the y coordinate of the location the taxipicked up the passenger.{ dropoff x: This is a variable that represents the x coordinate of the location the taxidropped o the passenger.{ dropoff y: This is a variable that represents the y coordinate of the location the taxidropped o the passenger.The response variable is:{ duration: which is the duration of the trip in seconds.
